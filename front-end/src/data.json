      "content": "Owner Alexandra hails from the great state of Florida, birthing her candle company on her momâ€™s dining room table. As a fun-loving creative, she wanted to create something with her hands that celebrated all the things we love about Florida. Alexandraâ€™s candles are very natural â€“ made with a coconut wax and infused with essential oils. She uses wooden wicks (or 100% cotton for the smaller candles) and has a select line of fragrances available on Etsy. Weâ€™ve had a great time getting to know her and what her products bring to the table.",
